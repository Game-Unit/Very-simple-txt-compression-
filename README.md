# Very simple txt compression 
This was a quick test on how compression could work nothing advanced.
To try it out drag a txt file and then click compress that sould create a text file in your downloads you can drag it drag the comprest file on the window again and press decompress to get the orgiginal file back.
this only realy works on file with lots of repeating characters like "AAAABBBBBBCCCCCC"
